                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>When we're first learning web development basics, and working by ourselves, we typically
                            start out using an FTP application to connect to our webserver and upload files and
                            overwrite existing files with our changes. As we grow, we have a local instance of our
                            site so we can test changes before uploading them to the live site. Pretty soon, your
                            website has dozens of interconnected files that each depend on one another for your site to
                            function. You start developing features that rely on the simultaneous release of many files
                            in order for things to keep working right - your style updates to the stylesheet, maybe
                            some markup changes in your templates, and updated application logic. Somewhere along the
                            way, you forget to make a note of that template file you changed on your local instance,
                            and it doesn't get migrated to the server - oops! The FTP method for releasing code does
                            not scale.</p>

                            <p>You realize you need help with your site so you set your friend up with FTP access,
                            they download your source files, and set to work on a new feature. A week later, they
                            upload their copy of the stylesheet with their changes, overwriting the new features
                            you've been adding all week with their local copy! FTP is not a suitable method for
                            teams to collaborate on code. Some Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like
                            Dreamweaver bake in functionality that relies on regular synchronization with the remote
                            server, and a system of lock files that indicate a particular file is being edited by
                            someone else. But even those tools fall short when your teammate forgets to unlock a file
                            and you're left wondering if it's safe to push your changes.</p>

                            <p>After a while, you start reading some User Experience blogs and you decide hop on the
                            latest design bandwagon. You refactor your whole site to a trendy new yellow on black
                            colorscheme with flat button styles and links with no underline. You manage to release
                            your masterpiece via FTP and you're met with plummeting traffic numbers and complaints
                            from your visitors, telling you the new colorscheme stinks and they can't figure out how
                            to navigate your site anymore. You start wishing you had taken backups of the code before
                            you changed it, or commented out components instead of replacing them. As time goes on,
                            and you find yourself wading through dozens of old backup files and defunct, commented-out
                            code, you see the light...</p>

                            Enter, Version Control Systems. A Version Control System is a tool that maintains an easily
                            referenced history of a codebase.

                            There are many options for version control systems, but CodeTN have settled on Git. Git is
                            exceedingly popular, thanks in part to being the brainchild of Linux Kernel founder, Linus
                            Torvalds. After starting out with Subversion (SVN) in 2008, the RSC E-commerce team switched
                            to Git, seeking better performance, fewer conflicts, and more flexibility. Initially, we
                            hosted our own Git server, but later transitioned to GitHub to store our code in the cloud.
                            Git can be used to collaborate and keep track of changes of any sort of files, including
                            images, but it works best when used to track changes in text-based files, like codefiles.

                            <p>Here are some important terms we'll be using in our discussion... a repository or "repo"
                            refers to a code-versioned codebase. You might decide to create your repo at the site-level,
                            at the application-level (like our team does with Magento and ExpressionEngine), or even
                            at a more granular level, such as a specific plugin or extension that is part of a larger
                            application. In Git, a repository within a repository is called a submodule.</p>

                            <p>A delta, usually called a "diff", is how Git tracks changes at the file level in the
                            different versions of your codebase. Git compares the old file and the new, line by
                            line, and can understand what has changed in the new file.</p>

                            <p>A commit is essentially a snapshot of the codebase at a given moment. When you take
                            a snapshot, or "commit your code," Git is tracking which files changed and the details of
                            those changes, or "diffs." Git generates a 32-character reference code for each commit,
                            called a commit hash. A responsible developer also stores a commit message with each
                            commit, describing the changes it references. A commit can be made for a single change
                            or it can include changes from the entire codebase.</p>

                            <p>In Git, a branch is technically just a reference, or pointer, to a single commit. It
                            might be easier to think of it as a timeline of commits. Every commit knows the commit
                            hash of its parent, so a sequence of commits form a timeline. If two commits share the same
                            parent commit, then you can easily distinguish the two by a branch name instead of by
                            their individual commit hashes. Committing to a branch moves the branch pointer to the new
                            commit, and the two branches diverge as the timeline extends with new commits. Sometimes
                            you need to refer to a specific commit, and using a branch name isn't suitable because
                            it is a moving pointer. In this case, you can "tag" a commit, which will remain a fixed
                            pointer to that commit's hash. Tags are useful for identifying release-worthy commits.
                            Another type of pointer is the special "HEAD" pointer, which points to the commit currently
                            represented or "tracked" by your codebase. You can "check out" different commits by
                            issuing the checkout command for a branch, commit hash, or tag, and Git will update your
                            local repository to reflect the state your code was in when the associated snapshot was
                            captured.</p>

                            <p>How do you bring two diverged branches of code back together? By creating a special
                            "merge" commit. This commit has two parents, and combines all the changes that were made to
                            each branch, all the way back to the point where they diverged. Both branches still exist
                            in the repository. If we merge branch A into branch B, then branch B will contain all the
                            changes performed in branch A, however branch A will remain unchanged. Subsequent commits
                            to branch A would continue to track in a separate timeline.</p>

                            <p>All of the above exist on your computer and can maintain a history of your local
                            repository. In order to collaborate, you need to introduce a remote instance of the
                            repository, sometimes referred to as an origin. Git can fetch changes from and push changes
                            to the remote repository. If Git finds new commits on the remote that don't exist in your
                            local repository, Git will require you to fetch the newer changes down to update your local.
                            This remote repository could be a machine you control, that runs the git server software,
                            or it could be located in the cloud, on Software as a Service such as GitHub or BitBucket.</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>By default, git will initialize a "master" branch. You and your team will need to agree
                            on what other branches you'll have beyond master. You may want to do some research, because
                            they can get pretty complicated, especially those designed for large, enterprise teams.
                            A good starting point would be to immediately create a "development" branch in your repo.
                            Then, when beginning work on a new feature, create a "feature branch" off of the development
                            branch with a name that describes your feature. When you complete work on your feature,
                            merge your feature branch into the development branch for more thorough testing in the
                            context of the rest of the team's changes. When the team has finished several features and
                            is ready to release them to their server, a team member would merge the development branch
                            up to the master branch, and tag the commit for easy checkout. The distinction between
                            development and master branches is important - imagine you release to production, and then
                            several features that haven't been fully tested or aren't ready for production get merged
                            to your master branch, and then you find a bug on production that you must quickly address!
                            With a good workflow, you can avoid letting a scenario like that become a problem because
                            your feature branches would be merged into development, leaving the master branch open for
                            bug fixing, also called "hotfixing."</p>
                            <p>These are more advanced techniques, and are not required by the contest, but they are
                            industry standard and strongly encouraged.</p>

                            <p>Some parts of your application will contain secrets, such as database connection
                            credentials. It is in your team's best interests to keep environment settings, private
                            data, and secret credentials out of Git. This way you can more comfortably share your
                            repository with others without giving away the keys to the castle (although exposing
                            your code repository, even if it contains no credentials, could give hackers a cheat sheet
                            for compromising your application). Also, as I mentioned before, Git works best for text
                            based files. While it can store binary files like images, or even video, doing so can
                            bloat your Git object cache, which is stored in a ".git" directory in the root directory
                            of your repository. This bloat negatively impacts Git's performance.</p>
                            <p>To combat these issues, you can use a special file with filename ".gitignore". This
                            file contains a list of file paths, file extensions, and filenames that should not be
                            tracked in Git. There is also the inverse, called a .gitkeep file. We can look at one in
                            the Laravel project's storage directory during the demo.</p>

                            <p>A merge conflict occurs when two commits that modify the same file or files are merged
                                and the changes cannot be automatically untangled by Git. Avoiding merge conflicts is
                                infinitely better than dealing with them. Getting in the habit of pulling down new
                                changes prior to pushing your changes up, regularly rebasing your feature branch on the
                                remote changes, and good code organization that limits team overlap can help avoid
                                conflicts and improve your experience with Git. Stash is an additional Git feature
                                that can help avoid conflicts by allowing you to store partial commits temporarily
                                and then reapply the changes later, all without committing them.</p>

                            <p>In the same vein as avoiding merge conflicts, you'll save your sanity by carefully
                                reviewing each file in every commit to ensure you haven't left any debug code in there,
                                or accidentally modified the wrong file. Commits can be reverted, but the reversion
                                is tracked as a new commit, so it's better to just avoid committing without careful
                                review of your changes. Don't commit too often, but commit often
                                enough to track your progress. Don't push a broken application to the remote repo,
                                your teammates will thank you! Keep a clean repository and the judges will
                                thank you too!</p>
